# DevTools Debugger

Practice using different features in your browser's DevTools Debugger to
understand interactive JS programs.

---

## Prep Work

- from `javascript.info`: [DevTools](https://javascript.info/devtools),
  [Debugging Chrome](https://javascript.info/debugging-chrome)
- Study
  [/3-understanding-programs/1-predicting-execution](../../3-understanding-programs/1-predicting-execution/?--defaults)
  - `devtool-setup.mp4`
  - `guide.mp4`
  - the JS files

## Learning Objectives

- ü•ö **Stepping Through**: You can use the _Step_ button to go through a program
  one statement at a time, pausing an any line you want to inspect.
- ü•ö **Scope Panel**: You can use the _Scope_ panel in your debugger to find the
  value of all active variables at step of execution, including when a variable
  is _uninitialized_.
- ü•ö **Hovering Previews**: You can preview the value of any expression or
  initialized variable in your program, including parts of a longer expression.
- üê£ **Continue to Here**: When paused in the debugger, you can skip the
  program's execution to a specific line using the "continue to here" option.
- üê£ **Breakpoints**: Once in the Debugger, you can set and unset breakpoints to
  skip ahead to specific lines. You can also set and unset breakpoints within a
  line when possible.
- üê• **`debugger` Statement**: You understand the difference between `debugger`
  and a breakpoint, and can write a `debugger` statement in your source code to
  pause the program before specific lines.
- üê• **Stepping Over**: You can step over functions in your program to skip
  their _implementation_ and focus on your program's behavior.

## During Class

Practice stepping and skipping through programs using your browser's debugger.

### Before Break

- **All Together**: A coach demonstrates the debugger features in
  `/1-isolate/examples`
- **In Small Groups**: Practice stepping through and predicting the programs in
  `/1-isolate/exercises`

**Break!**

### After Break

- **All Together**: A coach demonstrates how to step through JavaScript in an
  HTML project with `/2-integrate/examples`
- **In Small Groups**: Practice stepping through and predicting the programs in
  `/2-integrate/exercises`
- **All Together** Regroup with ~20 minutes left at the end of class for each
  group to present:
  - what went well?
  - what went less well?
  - lessons learned

## After Class

No deliverables. Just lots of study time, alone and in groups. Here's some ideas
for what to focus on after this lesson:

- Continue studying your favorite online tutorials
- Finish studying `/2-just-enough-javascript` if you haven't yet
- Study `/3-understanding-programs`
- `/0-flashcards`: ~20 minutes every day (add more cards as you go!)
