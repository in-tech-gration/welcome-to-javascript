# Tracing Variables

With HTML & CSS it's enough to learn what goes in and what comes out, you don't
need to know what happens in between:

- HTML/CSS --> ... ? ... --> a website

With JavaScript it's the opposite. The steps in the middle are what you should
_focus on learning_:

- input data --> **a lot of important steps** --> output data

Practice stepping through code the same way a computer does so you can
understand all of these important steps. You know you are doing well when you
can predict what the [trace] button will log to the console. The [table] button
can help you write your predictions before checking your guesses in the console.

## Trace Tables

Trace tables have been around as long as computer programming (probably). The
purpose of a trace table is to help you run the code in your head, keeping track
of all the variables in your program by hand. This is also called a _dry run_ or
a _desk check_.

The [table] button makes a trace table you can use to be the computer and to go
step by step through the program, recording each time a variable is declared,
read, or assigned. When you use the steps table you can check your work by
pressing `trace` button and comparing your table to the console output.

Don't worry if this is challenging, you'll have lots of opportunity to practice
tracing in this module.
