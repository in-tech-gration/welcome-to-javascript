# Writing & Reviewing

---

## Prep Work

- Study `/3-understanding-programs/7-code-review`
- Read through `/4-developing-programs/0-pair-programming`

---

## Learning Objectives

- ü•ö **Pair Programming**: You can explain the two roles in pair programming
  (_driver_ and _navigator_), and are comfortable trying either role.
- üê£ **Code Review**: You can work in pairs to review your classmates' programs,
  including incomplete programs or programs that do not work as expected.
- üê£ **Giving Feedback**: You can give constructive feedback to your classmates
  about their code after you had a chance to review it.
- üê£ **Learning From Code**: You can clearly explain at least 2 things you
  learned from studying your classmates' programs.
- üê• **Writing Programs**: You can use Pair Programming to write code to satisfy
  user a story, acceptance criteria & test cases.
- üêî **Multiple Solutions**: You can write more than one solution to the same
  code challenge.

## During Class

### Before Break

- **All Together**: Read through the challenge's specs, test cases & use the
  obfuscated solution so everyone understands the expected behavior.
- **In Pairs**: Practice pair programming by writing a solution to the
  challenge. Take your time and use the `review.js` as a guide to write the best
  code you can.
  - Done early? Try writing more solutions

**Break!**

### After Break

- **In Pairs**: Find another pair to work with:
  - Swap programs and review each others' code, without talking to each other!
    If one pair wrote more than one solution, just pick one to review
  - After both pairs are finished reviewing, get back together and discuss:
    _What did you do well_? _What could you do better_? _What did you learn from
    each other's code_?
- **All Together** Regroup with ~30 minutes left for each group of pairs to
  present:
  - what went well?
  - what went less well?
  - lessons learned

## After Class

No deliverables. Just lots of study time, alone and in groups. Here's some ideas
for what to focus on after this lesson:

- Continue studying your favorite online tutorials
- Study `/4-developing-programs`
- `/0-flashcards`: ~20 minutes every day (add more cards as you go!)
